# Birthday problem solver in Python

This project calculates the generalized birthday problem in the Python language using the `Decimal` class. It can be used from the command line as a standalone application or as a dependency from another project.

## Synopsis

Treats the generalized birthday problem for arbitrary values.
                 
Calculates the generalized birthday problem, the probability `P` that, when sampling uniformly at random `N` times (with replacement) from a set of `D` unique items, there is a non-unique
item among the `N` samples. In the original birthday problem formulation, `N` is 23 and `D` is 366 (or 365) for a risk of `P` â‰ˆ 0.5 = 50% of at least two people having the same birthday.

In mathematical terms, this can be expressed as

![Formula](formula.png)

since the probability of picking all of `N` unique is equal to the number of ways to pick `N` unique samples divided by number of ways to pick any `N` samples. This, of course, given
the assumption that all `D` items are equally probable.
 
The project supports calculating both the probability `P` from `N` and `D` (using exact method, exact method with Stirling's approximation in the calculation of faculties or Taylor approximation) and
`N` from `D` and `P` (using exact method or Taylor approximation). Both approximations get asymptotically close to the exact result as `D` grows towards infinity. The exact method should not be used for larger
numbers. For extremely small probabilities `P`, the exact method with Stirling's approximation used for faculties may become unstable as it involves many more different operations than
the Taylor approximation which, each, results in small round-offs. Another source of error in this case arises from the use of Stirling's formula for two calculations of faculties (`D!`
and `(D - N)!`). Since one of these (`(D - N)!`) diverges slightly more from the exact result than the other (`D!`), the difference between these (used for calculations in log space) might
introduce small errors when `P` is extremely small. A good check to see whether the approximation in question is suffering or not is to compare it to the Taylor approximation and see
whether they match well.

### As a dependency

The following shows example usage of this project in another application:

    from BirthdayProblem import BirthdayProblem
    from decimal import *
    
    # Program.py
    
    Solver = BirthdayProblem.Solver
    CalcPrecision = Solver.CalcPrecision
    
    [p, pMethod] = Solver.solveForP(Decimal('366'), Decimal('23'), False, False, CalcPrecision.EXACT)

## Change log

* *v. 1.0*
* *v. 1.1*
  *  Added rounding upwards (ceiling) instead of regular rounding (half up) on non-logarithmic solutions for `N`.
  *  Removed output approximation character on non-logarithmic solutions for `N`.
  *  Added flag `--prec` for command-line interface allowing the user to choose output precision, where applicable, in [0, 10] with default 10.
* *v. 1.2*
  *  Corrected calculation of adjusted precision during calculations.
  *  Added constants for repeatedly used values and replaced relevant uses.
  *  Corrected exact / naive calculation of `m` take `n`.
  *  Adjusted method using Stirling's formula so that it always returns probablity 0 or more (can otherwise return slightly less than 0 due to precision errors).
  *  Changed preprocessing so that the application fails whenever the max precision is insufficient to represent the resulting log of set size `D`.
  *  Small vocabular fixes in descriptions and comments.
  *  Fixed tests.
* *v. 1.3*
  *  Improved exception handling:
     *   Error codes
     *   Exception class
     *   Improved checks on input sizes before starting calculations
     *   Returning error codes when terminating program with an error
     *   Returning more specific error messages when a method fails
  *  Simplified conversion to log10 form in `_BirthdayProblemNumberFormatter.toLog10ReprOrNone`.
  *  Corrected precision bug in `_BirthdayProblemSolverChecked.birthdayProblemInv`.
  *  Corrected minor bug in `_BirthdayProblemTextFormatter.methodToText`.
  *  Simplified `_BirthdayProblemTextFormatter.methodToText` and `_BirthdayProblemTextFormatter.methodToDescription`.

* *v. 1.4*
  * Added exact method for calculating `N` given `D` and `P` using a numerical approach, this means that from now on
    multiple solution strategies can be used for this calculation as well (earlier this calculation always used Taylor
    approximation).
  * Fixed bug in method `facultyLog` for when input is 0. Since 0! = 1 and the return value is in log space, the
    correct answer is 0 and not 1.
  * Added trivial use case for calculating `N` using `D` and `P` when `D` is 1 and `P` is neither 0 nor 1 (in this case
    the answer is always 2).

* *v. 1.4.1*
  * Documentation, text and smaller fixes forgotten in v. 1.4.
  * Added tests where the project is used as a library (previous tests only used the project's command line API).
